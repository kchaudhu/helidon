There are 2 maven projects :-
1. employeeentry-AngularJS :- 
This is an AngularJS example that demonstrates how to connect to a Helidon MP backend. There is an Employe Entry form where user fills up some basic information such as id,
name and role and submits. This in turn calls the Helidon MP backend to save the data in an H2 database.
2. helidonH2Customized :-
This is a maven based Helidon MP application that has various REST end points for GET, PUT, POST and DELETE of employees.

There are individual README.md in each of the individual project folders for details on how to build and execute the individual projects.
